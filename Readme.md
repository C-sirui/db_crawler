crawler.py is entry point. Files are saved to htmls folder. Multithread code is commented out since only partially tested. Tqdm output is also not adjusted for multithreads yet.

For categories plz refer to catgories.py, where the parameters are listed there. Use the parameters defined here since some are different from the website's text.

fullfillment.py is dynmiacally dependent on categories. Pease ignore it for now.
